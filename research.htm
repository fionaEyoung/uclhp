          Streamline tractography, a technique for reconstructing white matter tracts from diffusion weighted MR images (DWI), has enabled significant
          advancements in neuroimaging and neuroscience research. Modern tractography techniques leverage high angular resolution DWI data and sophisticated
          processing pipelines to produce detailed and rich reconstructions of the brain's white matter pathways.
          Nevertheless, tractography remains afflicted by a range of issues including a persistent sensitivity / specificity trade-off and

        <h2>Jargon-free summary</h2>

          Brain surgery is, as you can imagine, quite a delicate process. The surgeon has to avoid hurting healthy
          brain structures while cutting out diseased tissue (e.g. tumours).
          So they use lots of different tools for "neuronavigation" to guide the surgery, and this can include using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
          Hospitals already regularly use MRI to map out important structures and their relation to surgical targets
          <i>prior</i> to surgery.<br>
          The particular sorts of structure I'm interested in are called fibre tracts, which are bundles of fibres that connect different parts of the brain,
          like a network of multicore cables.
          Unfortunately, a lot can change in the course surgery, as brain tissue is removed and squished around.
          Now, the images you acquired before surgery are no longer useful.
          This is where <i>intraoperative</i> MRI can help out!
          Re-scanning the patient part-way through surgery gives the surgeon updated information, allowing for more accurate and successful surgery.
          Hooray!<br>
          But not so fast. The information that comes fresh off the scanner is not useful yet.
          Lots of complicated image processing needs to be done before we can visualise specific structures (the tracts) in the brain.
          We could use the same image processing we used before surgery, but that takes a long time, is fiddly to get right, and requires an expert on hand.
          This sort of thing does not go down well with clinical radiologists, so we need an alternative.
          This is what my rearch is trying to address.
          How can we quickly and easily get that useful information out of our intraoperative MRI scan?
          I'm developing computational techniques for processing intraoperative MRI scans for neuronavigation.
