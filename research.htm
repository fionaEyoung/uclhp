        <h1>What is my PhD about again?</h1>
        <p>
          Mum, this is for you! You wanted a paragraph explaining my research for when someone asks you to explain it, so here you go.
        </p>
        <h2>Jargon-free summary</h2>
        <p>
          Brain surgery is, as you can imagine, quite a delicate process. The surgeon has to avoid damaging healthy
          brain structures while cutting out diseased tissue (e.g. tumours).
          There are many tools available to aid so-called "neuronavigation", including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
          Hospitals already regularly use MRI to map out important structures and their relation to surgical targets
          prior to surgery.
          Unfortunately, a lot can change in the course surgery, as brain tissue is removed and squished around.
          Now, the images you acquired before surgery are no longer useful.
          This is where <i>intraoperative</i> MRI can help out!
          Re-scanning the patient part-way through surgery gives the surgeon updated information, allowing for more accurate and successful surgery.
          Hooray!
          But not so fast. The information that comes fresh off the scanner is not useful yet.
          Lots of complicated image processing needs to be done before we can visualise specific structures in the brain.
          We could use the same image processing we used before surgery, but that takes a long time, is fiddly to get right, and requires an expert on hand.
          This is what my rearch is trying to address.
          How can we quickly and easily get that useful information out of our intraoperative MRI scan?
          I'm developing new computational techniques for processing intraoperative MRI scans for neuronavigation.
